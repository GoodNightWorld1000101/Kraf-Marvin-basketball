=== The programmers 

*Jaagup Jagomägi* and *Robin Subbi*

*Programming:*  

Overall, we think our code is very well written and commented. 
We experienced no major performance issues or bugs we couldn’t pinpoint, 
all of our solutions were pretty simple and intuitive 
and our robot always performed near the top of the roster. 

The only bad thing we could think of is that the code on the main branch 
is very old and meant for the test robot. After getting our new mechanics 
and electronics, we managed to repeatedly short circuit our mainboard, 
even 2 days before Delta X, and kept hopping between the new and old boards. 
Due to this constant back and forth rewriting to match different board firmware, 
we didn’t have the time (or energy) to merge the final code used in Delta X. 

=== The electronic

*Hanna Maria Fatkin*  

*Electronics:*  

Overall, I'm quite satisfied with how the project turned out, especially since the board worked as expected. 
However, one area I could have improved on was cable management. 
Unfortunately, we didn't collaborate enough with the mechanic, which led to a messy appearance. For future projects,  
I would ensure better coordination with the mechanic and plan cable routing more carefully to improve both  
functionality and aesthetics.

=== The mechanic
*Oliver Lentso*  

The robot turned out fine but if I'm being completely honest, I could've done a lot better.  
Most of the robot worked as intended but it could've been a lot better. For example, I  
messed up with the outer walls which caused issues with the ball (only once but still).  
The thrower worked well but not all of its features were well done. The angle regulator  
wasn't very stable. The second problem with the thrower was fitting it into the robot.  
When designing it I accounted for perfect cuts and bolts, but the real world isn't perfect   
so when it was time to assemble to robot the thrower was a tad bit too wide so it was a very  
tight fit which required some filing. Overall we decided to not use the angle regulator so the  
thrower was at a fixed angle of 20 degrees. It was 118mm long, 55.6mm wide and 64.9mm high.  
It was designed to use one thrower motor and one eating motor. One would throw the ball while the other would pick it up.  
Last but not least I should've communicated more with the electronic because the assembly was  
rough due to me not accounting for the wiring inside the robot. Overall it worked out, but I  
would definitely make the bot a bit prettier.

== Personal comments:  

=== Fatkin:  

I worked on the electronics for the robot.  
I learned how to create schematics, design PCBs,   
improved my soldering skills, and for the first time, I wrote firmware.   
Next time, I would probably try to communicate more with my teammates,  
as the programmers had a hard time getting their code to work with my board,   
and the mechanic struggled to fit my wiring properly.  
These issues could have been avoided if I had discussed   
things more thoroughly with everyone involved.  

I really enjoyed building the basketball robot because  
it gave me the opportunity to work on something very practical.   
For next year’s students, who are planning to do electronics,  
I highly recommend starting as early as possible and attending the lab sessions regularly.  
That way, you can get help along the way and are more likely to finish everything on time.  
Also, keep in mind that reviewing can take a lot of time.  

All the instructors I worked with were very helpful.   
I’d especially like to highlight Reiko,  
who provided very detailed and quick feedback,  
which was incredibly valuable.  

=== Jagomägi:  
I worked on the behavioural logic of the robot and calibrated the constants.  

I learned to suck it up and implement things I didn't need or want or use (logging),  
so I could get my code merged, as arguing with the instructors took more energy.  
On a more serious note, I learned about developing software as a team and  
how to make a robot behave how I wanted.  

Next time I would aim higher in terms of throwing accuracy. It was always just  
"good enough", but In the last day before the competition, I managed to improve  
the precision by over 4 times with some simple fixes.  

I liked the depth of the course - besides the starter code, the entire robot was  
made by our team, which gives a sense of pride in having accomplished something yourself.  

For the next year's students I recommend listening to the instructors and taking  
their advice to heart early. They know what they are talking about, and while you  
may disagree on some points, they are there to help you.  

For the instructors - you were wonderful, and I learned a lot, but I do have one more gripe:  
If I want to merge code for "3 of 11 balls", then I don't think I should have to  
develop solutions for something that only matters in "dealing with opponent robot".  
It doesn't matter that my code can't accurately measure distance with obstacles in the way -  
it is in no way required to complete my intended task, and not letting me merge or attempt  
the task due to that is stupid.  


=== Subbi:  
I mostly worked on image processing and movement.  

I learned how to do pair programming, as well as how to program independently without interfering  
with each other’s code. I also picked up some neat OpenCV functions and worked on omnidirectional movement logic.   
Additionally, I learned that things rarely go according to plan (e.g., our mainboard burned out two days before Delta X).  

Next time, I would calibrate the thrower for each 20 cm section of the field and use a formula  
specific to each section, rather than relying on a single formula. I would also adjust the  
camera positioning slightly to improve visibility of the lines. Another thing I’d change is  
not wasting a month doing nothing just because we were a month and a half ahead of schedule.  

I really enjoyed building this robot, especially since we worked exceptionally well as a team.  
Everyone completed their tasks and was always ready to help when needed. A major highlight for me  
was having 24-hour access to the field and lab, which allowed us to work until we were completely exhausted.  

For next year’s students, I suggest focusing on making their robot avoid balls that are too close to the basket   
and improving its throwing accuracy as much as possible.  

My suggestion for the instructors is related to Delta X. There should be a window before each match   
where both teams can adjust their robot’s thresholding. The time while the balls are being placed  
isn’t suitable for this, as instructors moving around on the court may step into the frame. Alternatively,  
the lighting on the court should remain consistent throughout the competition (though I understand this might be unrealistic).   
Additionally, the testing field should match the conditions of the main field. Otherwise, the testing field becomes  
almost useless and may lead to issues with the robot due to differences in environmental factors.  


=== Lentso:  
My job as the mechanic was to design and give my team a robot that could compete in Delta X.  
I'm happy with the robot and it got us to the finals which is really good but I put in a lot  
less effort in the second part of the semester than I should have. Nonetheless I learned  
a lot and I'm happy about that. I found a great love for mechanics and the production process.  

I learned how to design a robot from scratch to fit certain parameters and how to bring that  
design into reality. I got to use Fusion which I eventually came to enjoy. I found big  
differences between Fusion and Solidworks and what are the cons and pros of both which is  
handy for future projects.  

If we get more into specifics then I definitely learned a lot in terms of tolerances because  
the design in Fusion is perfect unlike the real world. I learned a lot about 3d printing as  
well as milling. I also learned how to use a lathe for metal parts. It was definitely the most  
interesting new skill because I had never done anything like it before.  

Overall I really liked this course, probably the most fun course so far and if I could I would  
love to take this course 2 more times just to try electronics and programming as well.   
I really liked the amount of independent work with a little bit of help here and there from the  
instructors. Without a doubt the best thing about the course was 24/7 access to the lab which  
gave me a really good chance to plan my time and when to work. Honestly I can't think of anything  
that I didn't like about this course.

My tips for the next year students would be to look at the task documentation. There's a lot of  
useful information there that I disregarded because I mostly tried to work out the logistics of   
mechanics on my own. Definitely listen to the instructors as well, most of the time if you get into   
an argument, they're right.  

Honestly I don't really have any criticism for the instructors. Usually when I wrote to one of them  
then I always got a response and some feedback.
